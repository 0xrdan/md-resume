Dear Hiring Team,

Opening paragraph — who you are, what you do, why you're writing. Lead with what you've built, not what you want. 2-3 sentences that make them want to keep reading.

**What I bring:**

Body section with specific evidence. Use bold labels and bullets:

- **First proof point**: Concrete example with quantified results where possible
- **Second proof point**: Another example that maps directly to job requirements
- **Third proof point**: Something that shows depth, not breadth

**Why this role:**

1-2 paragraphs connecting your motivation to the company's mission. Show you understand what they're building and why your experience matters for it.

Closing line — express interest, suggest next step. Keep it confident but not presumptuous.

Thank you for your consideration.

Your Name
